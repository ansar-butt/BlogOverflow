# BlogOverflow

**BlogOverflow** is a Stack Overflow-inspired platform for managing and interacting with Q&A content. It consists of two main components: a **frontend** built with React.js and a **backend** powered by Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## Project Structure

### 1. Backend: `projectbackend/`
The backend is responsible for handling the business logic, database interactions, and API endpoints. It is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.

#### Key Features:
- RESTful API for managing users, questions, and answers.
- Database models for core entities like `User`, `Question`, and `Answer`.
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- MongoDB for data persistence.

#### Directory Overview:
- **`fastflow/`**: Main backend application folder.
  - **`app.js`**: Entry point for the backend application.
  - **`bin/www`**: Script to start the server.
  - **`models/`**: Contains database models:
    - `answer.js`: Handles answers-related data.
    - `question.js`: Manages questions-related data.
    - `user.js`: Manages user-related data.
  - **`routes/`**: Defines API endpoints.
  - **`views/`**: Contains view templates (if applicable).
  - **`public/`**: Static files served by the backend.

#### How to Run the Backend:
1. Navigate to the `projectbackend/` directory:
   ```sh
   cd projectbackend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### 2. Frontend: `webproject/`
The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend. It is built using **React.js** and styled with CSS.

#### Key Features:
- Responsive design for a seamless user experience.
- Components for displaying questions, answers, and user profiles.
- Integration with the backend API for dynamic content.

#### Directory Overview:
- **`public/`**: Contains static assets like `index.html`, icons, and manifest files.
- **`src/`**: Main source code for the React application.
  - **`App.js`**: Main application component.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable React components.
  - **`utlis.js`**: Utility functions for the frontend.
  - **`theme.css`**: Styling for the application.

#### How to Run the Frontend:
1. Navigate to the `webproject/` directory:
   ```sh
   cd webproject
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.
